About Developer (English)
At Azizi, we believe in not just crafting beautiful homes, but beyond that, we are here to enrich the lives of people. To date, we have successfully delivered over 45,000+ homes across prime residential and commercial destinations. We currently have around 150,000 units under construction, valued at several tens of billions of US dollars.

We are renowned for developing the world’s second-tallest skyscraper, Burj Azizi, as well as the master-planned communities of Azizi Riviera, Azizi Venice, and Azizi Milan, among various other world-class projects across MBR City, Palm Jumeirah, Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai Healthcare City, Dubai South, Dubailand, Al Furjan, Studio City, Sports City, and Downtown Jebel Ali.

We have embarked on an extraordinary journey into hospitality, launching fifty stunning 5-star hotels and an iconic 7-star masterpiece, alongside other awe-inspiring tourist and leisurely attractions.

Our global expansion is well underway, with landmark projects already completed — and groundbreaking developments upcoming — across Germany, France, London, the USA, Australia, Canada, and beyond.
